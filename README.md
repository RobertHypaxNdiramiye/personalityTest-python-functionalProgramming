This personality test is constructed based on the Carl jung's theory of archetypes.
It is based on his example of Archetypes share by human beings.
Although these Archetypes are an incredibly useful tool, they are not the entire personality nor self of any human in the world.
The features of the human shadow (unconscious), self, and personality are infinite.

The test is built with python from an aproach of functional programming.
The python program reads a CSV file that contains the questions that a user may be pleased to answer. They are organised in a manner that is essential relative to the codes of program.
The python program will parse the results collected from the user and output a comprehensive description of ones personality.
